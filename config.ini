LEVEL =				32		-- Set this number equal to your character level
STRICTNESS =		70		-- Set this to a number between 0 and 100; anything above 0 is more strict than normal (higher number will show less items)

GOLD_STRICT =		3		-- Set this to a number between 0 and 10; Determines how strict the filter is on gold filtering (default = 3; set it to 0 to never filter gold)
BOOK_STRICT =		0		-- Set this to a number between 0 and 10; Determines how strict the filter is on books (default = 0; set it to 10 to never see books)
SCROLL_STRICT =		3		-- Set this to a number between 0 and 10; Determines how strict the filter is on scrolls (default = 3; set it to 10 to never see scrolls)

GOLD_LIMIT =		-1		-- This number is set automatically (based on Level and Strictness) but you may set it manually (set it to 0 to disable gold filtering, to always show gold; set it to -1 to use automatic filtering)
